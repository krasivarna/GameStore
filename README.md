Exercises: Spring Data Auto Mapping Objects
This document defines the exercise assignments for the "Spring Data" course @ SoftUni.
SoftUni Game Store
The game store is a platform, where the users can buy games. Your task is to create a console application for the store.
Data Models
Create the required entities. Use appropriate data types.
•	The system contains information about users and games.
•	Users can register in the system. After successful registration, the user has email, password, full name, list of games and information whether he/she is an administrator or not.
•	The first registered user becomes also an administrator. You can manually mark users as admins in the database.
•	A game has title, trailer (YouTube Video Id), image thumbnail (URL), size, price, description and release date
•	Users can make orders. Each order has a single buyer (user) and one or many products.
 Functionality
•	All users can view all games.
•	All users can view details of each game.
•	Logged-in users can logout.
•	Logged in users can add/remove games from their shopping cart. 
•	Logged in users can buy games that are added to the shopping cart and those games are added to the profile of the user and cannot be bought for second time.
•	Administrators can add, edit or delete games.
•	Basic user can not add, edit or delete game. 
1.	Design the Database
Design entity classes and create a database to hold the users, games and orders.
2.	Implement User Registration, Login and Logout
The guest users can register and log in. 
•	RegisterUser|<email>|<password>|<confirmPassword>|<fullName> - This command adds new user to the database in case of valid parameters. Otherwise, prints appropriate message informing why the user cannot be registered. The requirements for valid parameters are:
o	Email – must contain @ sign and a period. It must be unique.
o	Password – length must be at least 6 symbols and must contain at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase letter and 1 digit.
o	Confirm Password – must match the provided password.
•	LoginUser|<email>|<password> - This command sets the current logged in user if it exists. Otherwise, prints an appropriate message.
Logged in user can logout.
•	Logout – This command logs out the user from the system. If there is no logged in user, print appropriate message.
Example
Input	Output
RegisterUser|ivan@ivan.com|Ivan12|Ivan12|Ivan
LoginUser|ivan@ivan.com|Ivan12
Logout	Ivan was registered
Successfully logged in Ivan
User Ivan successfully logged out
RegisterUser|ivangmail.com|Ivan12|Ivan12|Ivan	Incorrect email.
LoginUser|ivan@ivan.com|Ivan
Incorrect username / password
Logout	Cannot log out. No user was logged in.
3.	Implement Managing Games
As an admin, you have the option to add/edit/delete games to the catalog. 
•	AddGame|<title>|<price>|<size>|<trailer>|<thubnailURL>|<description>|<releaseDate>
•	EditGame|<id>|<values> - A game should be edited in case of valid id. Otherwise, print appropriate message.
A game should be added/edited only to the catalog, if it matches the following criteria:
o	Title – has to begin with an uppercase letter and must have length between 3 and 100 symbols (inclusively).
o	Price – must be a positive number.
o	Size – must be a positive number.
o	Trailer – only videos from YouTube are allowed. Only their ID, which is a string of exactly 11 characters, should be saved to the database. 
For example, if the URL to the trailer is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edYCtaNueQY, the required part that must be saved into the database is edYCtaNueQY. That would be always the last 11 characters from the provided URL.
o	Thumbnail URL – it should be a plain text starting with http://, https:// 
o	Description – must be at least 20 symbols
•	DeleteGame|<id> - A game should be deleted in case of valid id. Otherwise, print an appropriate message.
